Source: https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga-what-you-need-to-know

Yoga should be adapted to the person practicing it. A “standard” pose can be appropriate for one person and inappropriate for another depending on health history, injuries, mobility, and conditioning. This document provides general safety guidance only.

## General safety rules
- Avoid sharp pain; discomfort is a stop signal.
- Progress gradually; do not chase extreme range of motion.
- Use props and modifications to reduce strain.
- Prioritize controlled breathing and stable transitions.

## Areas to be cautious with
- Inversions (headstand, handstand): require preparation and supervision.
- Deep backbends: avoid forcing the lower back.
- Intense breath practices: avoid strain, especially if prone to dizziness.
- Long holds under heavy load (wrists/shoulders): reduce intensity as needed.

## When to seek professional guidance
- Pregnancy or postpartum recovery
- Recent surgery or significant injury
- Known cardiovascular or blood pressure conditions
- Eye conditions where pressure is a concern
- Persistent numbness, tingling, or radiating pain

## Safer alternatives
- Supported restorative poses
- Gentle mobility and breath awareness
- Shorter holds with careful alignment
- Rest breaks whenever needed
