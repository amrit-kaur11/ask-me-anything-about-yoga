# Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Namaskar

Sun Salutation (Surya Namaskar) is a well-known sequence of movements often used as a warm-up in yoga practice. It typically combines forward folds, planks, a gentle backbend, and a return to standing, coordinated with the breath.

## General structure
While variations differ across styles, many Sun Salutation sequences include:
- Standing at the front of the mat
- Forward fold and half lift
- Stepping or jumping back to plank
- A controlled lowering phase (or a modification)
- A gentle chest-opening shape (cobra or upward-facing dog)
- Downward-Facing Dog
- Step forward and return to standing

## Why it is used
Sun Salutations are often practiced to:
- Warm the body before longer holds
- Coordinate breath and movement
- Build consistency and rhythm in practice

## Common beginner modifications
- Step back instead of jumping back
- Lower knees to the floor before lowering the chest
- Choose cobra (lower) instead of upward-facing dog (higher)
- Use blocks under hands in the half lift or forward fold

## Safety notes
Move slowly enough to maintain control. Avoid pushing into painful ranges in the lower back, wrists, or shoulders. If you have wrist discomfort, modify plank and downward dog using fists, blocks, or forearms, or reduce load.
