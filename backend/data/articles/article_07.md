# Yoga for Stress Reduction (General Guidance)

Source: https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/yoga-what-you-need-to-know

Many people practice yoga to support relaxation and manage daily stress. A calm yoga session often emphasizes slower movements, comfortable postures, and steady breathing. The intent is to create a sense of ease and reduce mental “noise,” not to push physical intensity.

## Helpful practice elements
- Gentle warm-ups (neck, shoulders, spine mobility)
- Longer holds in comfortable shapes (supported poses)
- Breath awareness (slow, steady breathing without strain)
- A longer relaxation period (such as Shavasana)

## Example calming mini-sequence
- 1–2 minutes: easy seated breathing
- 1–2 minutes: Cat–Cow movements
- 1–3 minutes: Child’s Pose (supported)
- 1–2 minutes: gentle supine twist (each side)
- 3–8 minutes: Shavasana

## What to avoid for calming sessions
- Very intense breath techniques
- Long, high-effort holds that create shaking or strain
- Rushing through transitions without breath control

## Safety notes
Yoga should feel stable and controlled. If stress is severe or you experience panic symptoms, consider working with a qualified healthcare professional.
