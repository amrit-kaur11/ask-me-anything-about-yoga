# Child’s Pose (Balasana) and Rest

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasana

Child’s Pose (Balasana) is commonly used as a resting posture in yoga practice. It can help you pause, observe the breath, and reset when a sequence feels demanding. Many practitioners use it between poses or whenever they need a break.

## How to practice
- Kneel comfortably and bring big toes together.
- Separate knees as needed to create space for the torso.
- Fold forward and rest forehead on the mat or a block.
- Arms can extend forward or rest by your sides.

## Modifications
- Place a cushion or folded blanket between thighs and calves if knees are sensitive.
- Use a block under the forehead for support.
- If knees or hips are uncomfortable, try a seated rest or lie on your back.

## Restorative intention
Child’s Pose can be practiced with an emphasis on minimal effort. The goal is to settle breathing and allow the body to feel supported. It is often paired with slow breathing and gentle attention to the back body.

## Safety notes
If you feel compression or discomfort in knees, hips, or ankles, adjust the pose or choose a different rest position.
