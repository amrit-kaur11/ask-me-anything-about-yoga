# Shavasana (Corpse Pose)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana

Shavasana (often called “Corpse Pose”) is a classic relaxation posture commonly practiced at the end of a yoga session. The goal is to reduce unnecessary muscular effort and allow the breath to become steady. In many yoga classes, it is used to transition from physical movement to rest and integration.

## How to set up
- Lie on your back with legs extended comfortably.
- Let your feet fall open naturally. Keep knees soft if needed.
- Rest arms a short distance from your body, palms facing up or neutral.
- Soften the shoulders and allow the back of the neck to feel long.

## What to focus on
- Breathe naturally without forcing the breath.
- Notice areas of tension (jaw, shoulders, belly, hips) and release gradually.
- If your mind wanders, gently return attention to the breath or body sensations.

## Common modifications
- Place a folded blanket under the head for neck comfort.
- Place a rolled blanket under knees if the lower back feels strained.
- Use an eye pillow or cover the eyes to reduce stimulation.

## Practical benefits (non-medical)
Shavasana is often used to cultivate rest, calm attention, and recovery after practice. Many practitioners find it helps them notice subtle sensations and learn how to relax the body deliberately. It can also be a useful moment to practice mindfulness: staying present with breath and body.

## Safety notes
If lying flat is uncomfortable, choose a supported version (knees supported, head supported) or lie on your side. If you experience dizziness, shortness of breath, or pain, stop and adjust or seek professional guidance.
