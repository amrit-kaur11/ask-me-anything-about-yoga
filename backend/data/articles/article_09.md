# Meditation and Mindfulness in Yoga

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation

Many yoga traditions include mindfulness and meditation as part of practice. In a modern yoga session, mindfulness can be as simple as paying attention to breath, body sensations, and the present moment without judgment.

## Simple mindfulness practice (beginner friendly)
- Sit comfortably with an upright posture.
- Notice the natural breath without forcing it.
- When attention drifts, gently return to breath or body sensation.
- Practice for 1–5 minutes to start.

## How mindfulness fits with movement
Mindfulness can be integrated into postures by:
- Observing the breath during holds
- Noticing where effort is necessary vs. unnecessary
- Using sensation as feedback to adjust intensity

## Common obstacles
- Restlessness: shorten the session and keep it consistent.
- Sleepiness: sit upright, practice earlier in the day, keep eyes softly open.
- Over-effort: simplify and return to gentle attention.

## Safety notes
Meditation should be gentle. If it triggers distressing thoughts or anxiety, shorten the practice, return to grounding activities, and consider guidance from a qualified professional.
