# Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adho_Mukha_Svanasana

Downward-Facing Dog is a foundational yoga posture that combines shoulder engagement, spinal length, and a hamstring/calf stretch. It appears in many styles of yoga and is often used as a transitional posture and a resting shape in flow sequences.

## Key alignment ideas
- Hands spread wide, fingers grounded.
- Hips lift up and back, creating a long spine.
- Knees can bend to keep the back long (especially for tight hamstrings).
- Heels may or may not touch the floor; comfort is more important than appearance.

## Common sensations
- Stretching in hamstrings and calves
- Effort in shoulders and upper back
- Weight distribution across hands and feet

## Modifications
- Bend knees to reduce strain and maintain a neutral spine.
- Shorten stance if the pose feels unstable.
- Use blocks under hands to elevate the floor if needed.
- Practice at the wall (hands on wall, hips back) for a gentle version.

## Safety notes
If you have wrist pain, reduce load or choose a modified version. If you feel sharp pain, numbness, or dizziness, come out of the posture and rest.
