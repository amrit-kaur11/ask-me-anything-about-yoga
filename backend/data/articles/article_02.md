# Pranayama Basics (Breath Practices)

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama

Pranayama refers to yogic breath practices. In modern practice, pranayama is often taught as a set of breathing techniques intended to improve attention and support calm, steady breathing. Many traditions emphasize that pranayama should be introduced gradually and practiced without strain.

## Principles for beginners
- Breathe smoothly; avoid forcing inhalations or exhalations.
- Keep the face, jaw, shoulders, and belly relaxed.
- If you feel dizzy or anxious, return to normal breathing.

## Simple practices
### 1) Diaphragmatic (belly) breathing
- Sit or lie comfortably.
- Inhale gently and feel the belly expand.
- Exhale softly and feel the belly release.
- Keep the breath quiet and even.

### 2) Equal breathing (Sama Vritti)
- Inhale for a count of 4.
- Exhale for a count of 4.
- Repeat for 1–3 minutes.
- If counting creates strain, drop the count and keep the breath even.

### 3) Extended exhale
- Inhale normally.
- Exhale a little longer than the inhale (for example, inhale 4, exhale 6).
- Keep it comfortable; do not push the exhale.

## How pranayama fits into yoga
Pranayama is commonly used before meditation or at the end of a practice to settle the nervous system and reduce restlessness. In many sequences, it is practiced after movement when the body is warm and the breath can be observed more easily.

## Safety notes
Avoid breath retention or intense breathing techniques unless guided by a qualified teacher. If you have medical conditions, especially involving the heart, blood pressure, or dizziness, keep practices gentle and consult a clinician or a certified yoga therapist before attempting advanced techniques.
