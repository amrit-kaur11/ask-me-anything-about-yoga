# Hatha Yoga for Beginners

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_yoga

Hatha yoga is a broad category of yoga practice that often emphasizes physical postures (asanas), basic breath awareness, and simple sequencing. Many beginner classes are labeled “Hatha” to indicate a slower pace and a focus on foundational alignment and posture education.

## What to expect in a beginner-friendly Hatha class
- Warm-up movements for joints and spine (gentle mobilization).
- Foundational standing poses to build stability and balance.
- Hip and hamstring stretches performed gradually.
- A short breathing practice and a relaxation posture at the end.

## Core concepts to learn
- Neutral spine and how to hinge from the hips.
- Stable foundation: feet, knees, pelvis alignment.
- Smooth, steady breathing during movement.
- Awareness: using sensation as feedback rather than pushing aggressively.

## Typical beginner sequence elements
- Cat–Cow variations for spine movement
- Downward-Facing Dog or a modified version
- Low lunge and simple standing poses
- Seated forward fold with modifications
- Supine twists and Shavasana

## Modifications are normal
Beginners often benefit from:
- Blocks under hands in forward folds
- A shorter stance in lunges
- Bent knees in hamstring stretches
- Support under hips when seated

## Safety notes
Yoga should not involve sharp pain. Mild stretching sensation is normal; sharp pain or numbness is a signal to stop and adjust. If you have a recent injury or medical condition, work with a qualified professional.
